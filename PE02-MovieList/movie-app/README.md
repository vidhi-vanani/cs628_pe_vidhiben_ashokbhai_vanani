# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Movie List

# Input  
The movie application accepts inputs in the form of an array of movie objects which can include properties: `title`, `genre`, and `release year`. The actual input comes from the user interacting with a dropdown menu (for reducing the movies by genre) and upon the user's clicking individual films, and these inputs are stored in the React state variables to watch the list of movies and the selected genre.

# Process  
In computing with JSX rendering and React hooks for maintaining states, the so-called `MovieList` React component affects the input. Just data received to draw dynamic movies, each movie as an item in a list or card, and then populate the dropdown with unique genres from the movies array. So, the choice made by the user about genre filtering sends the call to filter into the UI, affects a decision to display those choices on the screen, and extends to be an actual event and then a handler. That is how an event is generated by clicking a movie for a look at the movie title.

# Output   
What comes back to the user of the application is an interactive movie list responsive to almost all things that one might initiate or even consume. It reacts to rendering movies of the genre selected dynamically, as if one is supposed to either view a form or all movies under "All Genres." By clicking a movie, a real-time alert is triggered, and its title is posted, making it more interactive. The form is styled so that it looks very professional-rolled in CSS.
