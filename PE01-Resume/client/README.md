# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# MyResume 

# Input
The first interaction with the user when he writes a program is to develop an app with React "MyResume". It uses inputs as files like `Resume.js` and `Resume.css` to depict the resume page. The data transferred and the user puts it up in the resume are certain details like a person's name, contact details, aspects of education, skills, work experiences, and projects. These custom style-related metals are usually available to define items such as background color (`rgba(#bdfb04)`), formatting of text, and margins, and saved under a CSS file named `Resume.css`.

# Process  
React processes the input data to create and project a dynamically created resume. `Resume.js` componentizes the data into sections, and `Resume.css` is used to lay out and style the resume properly. This web app runs on a local development server with the command `npm start` to see the resume rendered in real-time. React efficiently updates the page with changes in the component or style.

# Output  
The output is a responsive web-based resume that is visually appealing. It features distinct sections, and well-structured layouts that contain personal information, educational history, skills, work experience, and projects. This application will make sure of a professional look from new design requirements such as background color, text alignment, font styles, etc. The result is a completely functional "MyResume" web app.
