# MyResume 

# Input
The first interaction with the user when he writes a program is to develop an app with React "MyResume". It uses inputs as files like `Resume.js` and `Resume.css` to depict the resume page. The data transferred and the user puts it up in the resume are certain details like a person's name, contact details, aspects of education, skills, work experiences, and projects. These custom style-related metals are usually available to define items such as background color (`rgba(#bdfb04)`), formatting of text, and margins, and saved under a CSS file named `Resume.css`.

# Process  
React processes the input data to create and project a dynamically created resume. `Resume.js` componentizes the data into sections, and `Resume.css` is used to lay out and style the resume properly. This web app runs on a local development server with the command `npm start` to see the resume rendered in real-time. React efficiently updates the page with changes in the component or style.

# Output  
The output is a responsive web-based resume that is visually appealing. It features distinct sections, and well-structured layouts that contain personal information, educational history, skills, work experience, and projects. This application will make sure of a professional look from new design requirements such as background color, text alignment, font styles, etc. The result is a completely functional "MyResume" web app.
